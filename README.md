## How UAPs Actually Work
Please refer to the PDFs and other documents in this repository for the MATH and PHYSICS calculations that supports the UAP postulations. All apparent observations of UAP performance and flight capabilities can be explained simply using orbital mechanics, tensile strength of materials, and good old-fashioned ingenuity. We have been looking at this method for PILOTING UAPs from space for a few months and the following is the MOST REASONABLE and PROBABLE answer. The MATH and PHYSICS literature to support this postulation is INCLUDED in this repository.

## Who:
A foreign adversary with space capabilities, involving a significant number of recent space launches and payloads. This adversary is known for its high-tech manufacturing capabilities and a strong desire to use surveillance as a means to collect intelligence. They may also possess extensive experience in entertainment, including the use of invisible wires for various purposes (such as filiming martial artists who posses the magical skill of flight) achieved also through invisible wires.

## What:
Lightweight surveillance probes suspended by invisible woven fiber-optic cables. These high-strength data transmission cables are lowered or dropped from low Earth geosynchronous orbit satellites.

## Why:
Simple SPY EAVESDROPPING on opponent from stealth. The purpose is to monitor, spy, steal, and or collect MILITARY and industrial data silently without any noise and with minimal electronic exposure.

## How:
Sensor probes may come in various designs and configurations, including single tether and multi-tether setups that can be implemented with small maneuverable satellites. The probes are allowed to spool ahead of the satellite by many miles, and the invisible clear glass cables are kept taut, allowing the maneuvering of a probe to be a matter of simply using compressed air thrusters. Refer to the included documents for more details.

## HOW 2:
A large spool of custom braided transparent FIBER OPTIC cable is delivered to a SATELLITE or SPACE Station , it is then attached to small micro-satelites equiped with a high performance FISHING REEL and low cost compressed air THRUSTERS. If the SPY PROBE is detected the highly maneuverable SATELLITE may also have a small rocket propellant thruster that allows rapid evasion.

## HOW UAPs TRAVEL THOUSANDS OF KPH/MPH WITH NO APPARENT PROPULSION. 
UAPs have been observed to travel 2000MPH. How this is performed.
Its is not really that hard to do, in fact this is very siple newtonian mechanics, any object traveling at nearly 17,000 MPH simply needs to fire an inverse thruster in any available opposing direction to its current vector. From the observer (inside the atmosphere) or at the surface of the Earth will see the object move away from their observational position at high speed.
Simply put these UAPs are suspended from one or more clear glass WOVEN fiber optic  cables. There is no propulsion because the movement and control of the SENSOR probe is a product of the GEO-SYNC satellite hundreds of miles above firing a THRUSTER in the opposite vector.  Becasue the object suspended from the cable is taut at the end of the cable it will suddenly move away from observer at thousands of miles per hour. It is not MAGIC and it is NOT a new drive. The space END of the ANCHOR is moving 17k MPH and the low atmoshere end of the puppet is moving only a few hundred miles.  The HIGH speed it a factor of The magic of GEO SYNC orbit with a very long string. 

##  OCCAM's RAZOR
Why doesn't the transparent cable get hot and melt? 

FACT: Dropping an object slowly from a GEO SYNC anchor in orbit into the atmosphere prevents the cable from heating up. The upper part of the cable is shielded against friction with transparent plastic Teflon, and the atmosphere is very thin, so particles are far apart. Lower along the cable, where the fiber-optic tapers off, it reduces to just a few clear optic threads. This continues for the final 10,000 feet of cable, where it connects to the SPY PROBE sensor.

The sensors are lightweight, typically weighing only a few dozen pounds, and are often mounted on a gimbal inside a clear plastic sphere. The sphere is connected at the corners with several self-balancing motors, allowing for device rotation and adaptive camera positioning to keep it level.

Now, for the significant disclosure: Essentially, we have a spy surveillance sensor lowered into the atmosphere on the end of a rigid fishing line. This explains why objects shot down have been found with "strings" attached to them. On occasion, spherical plastic shells are used to prevent the device from being buffeted by the wind. A high-end gimbal and rotating ball hinge provide plumb adjustments while in motion. Additionally, they may coat the capsule/tic-tac with transparent plastic Teflon or reflective Mylar, giving the object a metallic appearance.

#### Theory and Applications of Multi-Tethers in Space
Fan Zhang, Panfeng Huang

This book offers a comprehensive overview of recently developed space multi-tethers, such as maneuverable space tethered nets and space tethered formation. For each application, it provides detailed derivatives to describe and analyze the mathematical model of the system, and then discusses the design and proof of different control schemes for various problems. The dynamics modeling presented is based on Newton and Lagrangian mechanics, and the book also introduces Hamilton mechanics and Poincar√© surface of section for dynamics analysis, and employs both centralized and distributed controllers to derive the formation question of the multi-tethered system. In addition to the equations and text, it includes 3D design drawings, schematic diagrams, control scheme blocks and tables to make it easy to understand. This book is intended for researchers and graduate students in the fields of astronautics, control science, and engineering.
